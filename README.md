# AntiBadUsb
This repository is composed of two types of code. One for Arduino and the other for STM32. After detecting the BadUSB and/or the HID attackers, these codes could disable the bad device. Beware: this project is based on Arduino DUE and STM32F030. For closely related chips there might not be a problem to run the code, but for chips like STM32F103, you might need to change some of the code.
